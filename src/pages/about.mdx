Hi! my name is Rafey. I'm a final year CS student at Zakir Husain College of Engg & Technology, AMU. I'm currently working at [CodeCrafters(YC S22)](https://codecrafters.io/) as a technical writer and software developer. 

Outside of programming, I love playing and watching football. I grew up playing the sport and it is very dear to my heart. I also love reading fantasy novels and playing chess. 

* hello
