One of my biggest annoyances while editing text or navigating around outside of my code editor is having to move my fingers away from the home-row so I can use the arrow keys. Whether it's fixing a typo in a URL, writing a tweet, selecting an item from a drop-down, this problem creeps up multiple times a day.

I even [tweeted](https://x.com/rafeytwt/status/1788863831143268528) about it, asking for solutions but in vain.

I thought:
> It can't just be me. Surely, other people have had this problem too, right?

Enter the [Extend Layer](https://colemakmods.github.io/ergonomic-mods/extend.html).

<Frame src={minimalExtendLayer} caption="This is a rocketship. These are some extra words and some more gibberish so i can see how it formats looooooooooooooooooong captions"></Frame>

Think of a *layer* as a different "mode" or "level" of your keyboard. When you hold down `Fn`, you activate the "Function Layer" which remaps some of your Function Keys (F1-F12) to adjust volume or brightness. When you hold down `Shift`, you remap `a` to `A` and `1` to `!`. So you've already been using layers.

The Extend Layer brings your arrow keys on the home-row.
