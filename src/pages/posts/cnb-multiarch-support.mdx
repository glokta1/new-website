## Problem

Currently `pack` can only build images for the same architecture as the host system.

## Goal

Provide option for cross compiling to different architectures and OS'es in `pack` CLI

## Understanding

- What are Cloud Native Buildpacks?
  - Dockerfiles vs CNBs https://tanzu.vmware.com/developer/blog/understanding-the-differences-between-dockerfile-and-cloud-native-buildpacks/
  - CNBs are readymade, rigorous, battle-tested `Dockerfiles` that you can include in your projects instead of making ones yourself. Saves time, improves security, at the cost of flexibility like with anything pre-made. Think pre-built PCs vs Custom PCs
- How is `pack` related to CNBs?
  - A CLI tool to use CNBs

## `pack` steps

1. Spin up container of builder img
2. Mount application source code on top of it
3. Invoke the `steps` binary present in the builder container which starts the Buildpack Lifecycle
