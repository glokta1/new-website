      Hi! My name is Rafey. I'm a final year CS student. I'm currently working
      at <a href="https://codecrafters.io/">CodeCrafters(YC S22)</a> as a technical
      writer and software developer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside of programming, my hobbies include playing football, reading
      fantasy novels and writing.

    <h2>My inspiration</h2>
    <blockquote>An idiot admires complexity, a genius admires simplicity.</blockquote>
    <p>
      My philosophy of writing software is deeply inspired by an <a
        href="https://nadh.in/blog/fomo-yamo/">article</a
      > I read a few years ago by Kailash Nadh (Zerodha's CTO). Ever since, with everything I work on, I try to use the right tool for the right job. I aim for the simplest solution.
