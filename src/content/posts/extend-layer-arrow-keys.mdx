Learning Vim was one of the best investments I made. I use a Vim extension for VSCode and it's made navigating and editing code frictionless. The problem? Working with text outside VSCode feels like going back to the Stone Age. Whether it's fixing a typo in a URL, writing a tweet, selecting an item from a drop-down, this problem creeps up multiple times a day.

When you hold down `Fn`, you activate the "Function Layer" which remaps some of your Function Keys (F1-F12) to adjust volume or brightness. When you hold down `Shift`, you remap `a` to `A` and `1` to `!`. So you've already been using layers.

The Extend Layer simply extends (haha, geddit?) this concept to
